<h3>
What's inside?</h3>
This release ensures compatibility of the Modeler with the latest attributes introduced in Camunda BPM 7.2.<br />
<br />
Roman has done a great job updating the meta model of the Modeler so that BPMN 2.0 XMLs which contain i/o-mapping and script attributes can now be opened.<br />
<br />
Additionally, we are happy that two pull requests from our great community are included in this release.<br />
<br />
<h3>
What's next?</h3>
<div>
Currently we are working on the 2.7.0 version of our Modeler, which will expose the attributes we have added with 2.6.1 on the properties panel, namely i/o mapping, scripts and asyncBefore/asyncAfter.&nbsp;</div>
