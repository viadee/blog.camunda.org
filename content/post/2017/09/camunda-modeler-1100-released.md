## Default Element Templates Improvements

We introduced [default element templates](https://blog.camunda.org/post/2017/02/camunda-modeler-017-released/) in version 1.7.0. With this release, they are also applied to elements of newly created diagrams. Therefore you can now also use them for BPMN processes.

## Toggle and Reset Properties Panel

You can now toggle and reset the BPMN and CMMN properties panel using the menu or keyboard shortcuts.
