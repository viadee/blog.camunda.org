We are happy to announce the Camunda Modeler version 1.8.2 release!

This patch release contains a bug fix where changing process properties using the properties panel led to inconsistencies and made modeling the diagram impossible.

We recommend all users of version 1.8.1 to [download](https://camunda.org/bpmn/tool/) the new version from [camunda.org](https://camunda.org/bpmn/tool/) as soon as possible.

You can learn about all new features introduced in version 1.8.1 in [this blog post](http://blog.camunda.org/post/2017/06/camunda-modeler-0181-released/).


## What's next?

In our current milestone we will focus on reworking text annotations and further improving the usability of the Camunda Modeler.
