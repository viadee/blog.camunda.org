## Grid Snapping

From now on, all the dragged elements are automatically snapped to an invisible grid. Thanks to this, it is much easier to create clear and readable BPMN diagrams.

## Resize To the Same Size

Resizing elements to the same size is now much easier thanks to additional snapping lines. Thus, the diagrams appear as clean and readable.

## Group Support

Camunda Modeler already allows to group elements with colors. Now, you can do this also with a BPMN Group element.
