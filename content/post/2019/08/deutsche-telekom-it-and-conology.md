## CamundaCon preview:

### Q: What will you present?
A: The transformation of a monolithic BPEL application into a microservice setup, with Camunda as the Embedded BPMN Engine.

### Q: What motivates you to share your use case?
A: The use of BPMN as a link between business and IT and the feasibility of modeling. Plus, the ease of integrating the Camunda Engine as a simple Java library into a complex Microservice MeshUp.

### Abstract
We will describe the transformation of a monolith application to a Microservice-based Camunda inherited architecture. Coming from a technical point of view, with BPEL we had to abstract to a business-oriented process flow using BPMN. Just changing a few letters? Far from it!
Setting the scene of the challenges of Telekom IT as a large IT company changing from an organizational implemented waterfall development process, into a software development company facilitating agile principles. Striving the raising complexity due to an agile transformation as well as the utilization of the Cloud and DevOps.

We will highlight the Pros and Cons and how to tackle the challenges of a big transformation initiative within the current teams. We will take a journey through several viewpoints where we show you challenges and advantages we met on our way so far.
