We continue to grow quickly and introduce a lot of value across Camunda BPM, our complete process automation platform with powerful execution engines for BPMN workflows and DMN decisions paired with tools for collaboration, modeling, operations and analytics. To help you keep abreast of what is coming and when, we are changing our software release cadence.

## Camunda BPM Full Stack Releases

We are introducing the concept of “Full Stack Releases,” which bundle new versions of all modules of Camunda BPM so they are feature-matched. This includes:

* BPM Runtime (Engine, Cockpit, Tasklist, Admin)
* Optimize
* Cawemo
* Modeler

Full stack releases happen on the second Tuesday of every April and October. For example, the next Camunda BPM full stack release (7.14) is scheduled for Tuesday, October 13th, 2020.

## Adjustment of Camunda BPM Runtime Release dates
The biggest change that you'll notice is that BPM Runtime will no longer be released on May 31st  and November 30th, but will instead be released with the rest of the stack on the second Tuesday of April and October.

## Quarterly Minor Releases of Optimize and Cawemo
Optimize and Cawemo participate in the full stack release but also produce an additional minor release on the second Tuesday of every January and July.

## Monthly Modeler Releases
The Camunda Modeler produces monthly releases which may be [alpha](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/3740/alpha-version) or [minor](https://semver.org/) releases but will always align with the full stack releases in April and October.
