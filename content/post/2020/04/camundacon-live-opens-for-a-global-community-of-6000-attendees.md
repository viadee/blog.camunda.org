It was just one month ago that we opened registration for our first global online conference for process automation -- **[CamundaCon LIVE](http://www.camundacon.com/live)**. We originally planned to host our annual CamundaCon conference in New York City, but like so many others had to quickly pivot to an online event when it was clear the pandemic would prevent us from gathering.

While we miss seeing our community, customers, partners, and friends in person, we’re excited to get started. We have an outstanding agenda with 28 speakers and 24 sessions, and best of all, our virtual conference expands access to so many more people than would be otherwise possible. ***More than 6,000 people have registered*** for the two-day event, representing 4,000 organizations and more than 150 countries across six continents. Our passionate community is coming together from every corner of the globe.

And we have an agenda that’s not to be missed. Today’s sessions will open with a keynote by our CEO and Co-Founder Jakob Freund and will include insightful sessions with process automation experts from Societe Generale, Keller Williams, Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan, and 24 Hour Fitness.  Alongside, deep-dive technical sessions from Camunda experts will cover security and migration strategies. Additionally, we’ll have an expert panel discussing the promise and peril of RPA, with experts from Nokia, Deutsche Telekom, and NatWest Group, moderated by Intellyx’s Jason Bloomberg.

Friday’s agenda will kick off exploring technology and product trends with our Chief Technologist and Co-Founder Bernd Ruecker and CTO Daniel Meyer. They are followed by more expert and best practice sessions from Capital One, Fidelity, and Goldman Sachs, and a must-see panel on digital transformation. We’re proud to bring this depth of speakers and experience to a global audience, and know you’ll walk away with new ideas, best practices and insights for your next process automation project.

As of this morning there is already a lively conversation going on in the event’s Slack channel with members of the global Camunda community. I regret we can’t shake hands at the event in New York, but I am looking forward to chatting with many more online on Slack or on social media -- search #CamundaCon to join the conversation.

Registration is still open, and it’s free. Don’t miss your best chance to connect directly with the global Camunda community. Get started at [https://www.camundacon.com/live/](https://www.camundacon.com/live/)
