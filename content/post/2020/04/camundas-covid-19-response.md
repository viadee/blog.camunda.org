Coronavirus has changed the world as we know it and together we’re navigating a new normal. The incredible worldwide response to this challenge is truly inspiring, especially the way individuals and organizations are rapidly developing solutions to a whole new set of problems. We want to help you any way we can.

We have seen many organizations pivoting fast to respond to urgent needs - either to support the overburdened health care systems directly, to help manage unexpected customer needs or to better organize tasks for a workforce that is suddenly working remotely. These shifts in demands and how business gets done, brought on by the pandemic, may have transformed operations that now require technological orchestration and process automation across thousands of individuals, countries, languages and time zones. And we realize that many of you might not have the tools and resources to quickly adapt your systems to cope with these challenges.

This is why we've put together a special package for initiatives and organizations helping society tackle the challenges of COVID-19 -- we will donate our Enterprise products for  qualified organizations completely free of charge, so you can scale operations as fast as possible. Our experts will help your teams hit the ground running with Camunda consulting and online training. Plus our experienced support teams will be on hand to help each step of the way, as you tackle the most challenging issues we have faced as a global society.

__One project at a time: connecting health care workers with supplies__

We’re proud to be working with the incredible RemedyMatch - a logistics platform that matches donated protective medical articles like gloves, masks, coats and disinfectants, with organizations who need them, such as clinics, resident doctors, nurses, retail workers or people caring for sick relatives. We found each other through the **[WirVSVirus](https://wirvsvirushackathon.org/?lang=en)** hackathon - an initiative run by the German government in March to develop, test and improve solutions for emerging challenges surrounding COVID-19.
