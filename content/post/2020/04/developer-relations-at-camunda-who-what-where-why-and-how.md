If you’ve been part of the Camunda community for a while, you’ve likely interacted with Niall, Mauricio or Josh on the Camunda and Zeebe forums. You’ve probably met Bernd at a conference or two in the last few years. And if you’re one of our awesome Camunda meetup organizers, you’ve definitely worked with Luca to make sure your event is a smashing success. But did you know they’re all part of the larger Developer Relations (or DevRel) department at Camunda?

Perhaps we should start by explaining __what Developer Relations is__. At its foundation, the purpose of Developer Relations is to build relationships with and enable our technical communities. Still scratching your head? Here’s how it works:

To the company, we represent the community.
To the community, we represent the company.

Similar to Public Relations or Government Relations, we build relationships with a specific audience, conveying important information to them, while at the same time, accepting opinions and feedback that we then convey back to our company. (Shoutout to Yoshi Yamaguchi for the [great analogy](https://ymotongpoo.hatenablog.com/entry/2019/04/26/084500)!)

So __how does this translate to Camunda__, and more importantly, what does it mean for you? It means that while we’ve always had your best interests at heart (and that will never change!), we now have a team officially dedicated to making sure that your feedback is heard and that you have the best experience possible as you’re using our products.

In fact, our mission sums it up nicely:

***The Camunda Developer Relations team exists to serve the Camunda developer community,***
***from internal employees to Open Source contributors,***
***Enterprise customers, and the broader tech community.***

***It is our goal to provide opportunities for developers to be more successful by making them aware of our solutions, enabling them to be successful through great experiences, and fostering a culture of collaboration.***

What does this mean for you going forward?

- We’ll continue to provide awesome content for you in the form of tutorials, getting started guides, blog posts, sample applications and more.

- We’ll be asking for your feedback on new features, as well as reaching out to see how your experience has been as you get up and running with our products.

- We’ll be more proactive about discovering what awesome projects you’re creating in your own time that use Camunda, Camunda Cloud, and bpmn.io, and partnering with you to promote them on a variety of channels.

Most importantly, we’re 100% invested in helping you be successful in using Camunda products as well as in your overarching career as you explore new technologies and possibilities. By making you aware of the products and services we have to offer, enabling you to get the most out of those products through content and excellent experiences, and helping you to engage and collaborate with other Camunda community members, we help you be the best you can be.

__Why are we so invested in this?__ As a team that’s driven by helping others, making sure you have a great experience with anything and everything related to Camunda is what gets us excited to come to work everyday!

So __where does this work take place and who makes up the DevRel team?__ We’re spread out all over the world, quite literally, from Brisbane to London, Berlin, San Francisco, and Seattle.

Niall Deehan, Mauricio Salatino, and Josh Wulf are our three Developer Advocates, focused on creating content, sample applications, and demos for Camunda BPM and Zeebe. Luca Buchholz is our Community Marketing Manager, working with those of you who run Camunda meetups around the world. Danielle Andrist is our Program Manager, and a new addition to the team, concentrating on building some processes and tooling to an already great foundation.

Bernd Ruecker, as Co Founder and Chief Technologist of Camunda, is our honorary member of the team. He’s still delivering great content in the form of blog posts and conference talks around the world.

And I’m Mary Thengvall - Director of the team. I’m building a longer-term strategy and vision around Developer Experience, Developer Advocacy, and Developer Community at Camunda (keep an eye on [my blog](https://marythengvall.com/blog) for more information about that soon!). It’s my pleasure to guide these awesome Developer Relations professionals and work across teams at Camunda to make sure we’re creating the best products for you, our community. After all, that’s what it’s all about!
