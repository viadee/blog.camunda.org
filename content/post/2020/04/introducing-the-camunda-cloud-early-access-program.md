At CamundaCon Live today, I was thrilled to unveil the next step on the Camunda Cloud roadmap - the Camunda Cloud Early Access Program. Now your team can get started on Camunda Cloud, running your clusters with more resources, a higher replication factor and a higher partition count.

Since we first announced Camunda Cloud at CamundaCon Berlin last year, we’ve gained valuable insight from our early adopters in our private and [public betas](https://blog.camunda.com/post/2020/01/announcing-camunda-cloud-public-beta/). We’ve poured these insights into developing a robust BPMN-based workflow technology engineered specifically for the cloud, based on our horizontally scalable workflow engineering Zeebe, and available as an on-demand cloud service.

Our early access program includes a number of new capabilities to ensure you can seamlessly design, automate and monitor processes as a team, scaling as needed:

__Single-AZ replication__ - fault tolerant Zeebe brokers protect your workloads from outages.

__Add Production Clusters as needed__ - provision more Zeebe clusters at the click of a button.

__Operate__ - built specifically for monitoring and managing workflows running in Camunda Cloud, Operate gives end-to-end visibility and control of workflows.

We’re also including __dedicated professional support__ for the first time, between 08:00 - 17:00 CEST (Berlin), so you can collaborate closely with our highly skilled team to make your projects successful.

You can [sign up for the Early Access Program](https://camunda.com/products/cloud/) here and check out the [Zeebe Forum](https://forum.zeebe.io/), where our active community discusses all aspects of our Camunda Cloud and Zeebe products.
