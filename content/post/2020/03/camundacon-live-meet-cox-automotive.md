[Cox Automotive](https://www.coxautoinc.com/), the world’s leader in vehicle remarketing services and digital marketing and software solutions for automotive dealers and consumers, has modernized its Dealer track Registration and Title processes by moving towards a microservice architecture - enabling multiple solutions from an ecosystem of services. Using Camunda, Cox Automotive was able to create three products from a single solution by developing independent processes to handle manual and automated tasks in unique ways.

We spoke with Senior Software Engineer [Mary Rose Matira](https://www.camundacon.com/live/speakers/), who’ll be presenting: [Three Products - One Microservice Ecosystem at Cox Automotive](https://www.camundacon.com/live/agenda-day2/) at CamundaCon Live.
