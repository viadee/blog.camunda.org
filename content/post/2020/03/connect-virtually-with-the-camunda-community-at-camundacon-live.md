As we all adjust to remote work, away from colleagues and friends in response to COVID-19, a silver lining in this challenging time is the opportunity to bring the global Camunda Community together virtually, welcoming more of you than ever before to join our CamundaCon Live conference

__Live Case Studies and Technical Tracks__

We've lined up more than 20 fantastic speakers from leading organizations including Capital One, Fidelity Investments, Goldman Sachs, Keller Williams, Nokia Bell Labs, Societe Generale, and 24 Hour Fitness, who’ll share how they’re deploying workflow and decision automation within their organization to achieve better customer experiences and business outcomes.

Plus we'll have technical tracks and live discussions from Camunda experts, sharing product updates and inspiration, including an overview of the Camunda product roadmap from our CTO Daniel Meyer.
