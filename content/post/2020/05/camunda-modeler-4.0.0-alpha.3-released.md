## New Camunda Modeler Icon

[As a part of Camunda rebranding](https://blog.camunda.com/post/2020/01/something-bold-something-new-fresh-look/), we are saying goodbye to our old Camunda Modeler icon and introducing the new one with this alpha release. You may see this icon in your taskbar, app launch menu, etc.

[Please let us know](https://forum.camunda.org/c/modeler) how you feel about the new icon.

## Error Tracking

This alpha release ships with an error tracking feature for those who enabled the `Enable Error Reports` option in the Privacy Preferences. You can always turn on/off this feature by going to `Help>Privacy Preferences`.
