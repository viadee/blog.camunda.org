Today we release the first version of the new [Camunda Modeler](https://github.com/camunda/camunda-modeler) to the public. The new modeler is a desktop application and integrated modeling solution for BPMN 2.0 and DMN 1.1. It builds on top of the BPMN 2.0 and DMN tooling provided by [bpmn.io](http://bpmn.io) and brings its simplicity, performance and style to every computer.

[Download](http://camunda.org/bpmn/tool) the new Modeler from [camunda.org](http://camunda.org/bpmn/tool) and start building BPMN 2.0 diagrams better and faster today.


## Current Feature Set

The modeler provides you with a rich modeling tooling, including:

* Modeling of BPMN 2.0 process and collaboration diagrams
* Editing of BPMN 2.0 and [Camunda](http://camunda.org) properties via a properties panel
* Modeling of DMN 1.1 tables
* Tabbing (multiple diagrams open)
* History with Undo and Redo
* Native Operating system integration for Windows and Mac

(You will find most modeling features from our [Eclipse BPMN 2.0 Plug-in](https://github.com/camunda/camunda-eclipse-plugin) in the new modeler, too).

The modeler supports the new `camunda` BPMN 2.0 XML extension namespace and works with [Camunda BPM 7.4](/post/2015/11/camunda-bpm-740-released).


## Future Planning

Next versions of the modeler will feature

* Complete BPMN 2.0 modeling support
* Complete `camunda` extension support (via properties panel)
* Better validation
* Better integration of DMN tables and BPMN 2.0 rule tasks
* Improved operating system integration
* XML editing
